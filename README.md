# Flyway Example

This is a sketch showing how to use [Flyway](http://flywaydb.org/) to manage migrations.  This is dependent on the application `flyway` being accessible on the load path, and the database that will have migrations performed on it already existing.

To use this, just run the `./migrate` command from the command line.  Easy peasy.
